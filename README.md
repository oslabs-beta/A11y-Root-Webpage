# A11y Root Webpage

[A11y Root](https://a11yroot.dev/) is an open source VS code extension and accompanying webpage designed to enable developers and interdisciplinary teams to collaboratively address user accessibility of their projects throughout the development process.

At its root, the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/A11y-Root-Extension) allows developers to generate and receive feedback on the accessibility tree of a webpage, whether in production or in a dev environment. Check out the [README](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/A11y-Root-Extension/blob/dev/README.md) for the extension for more details on getting started.

Once a tree is generated, it is stored in a database and associated to the developer's github account (via Github OAuth). This enables a developer to access the same tree/feedback on the A11y Root webpage, as well as create a direct link to the tree which can be shared with other project contributors, such as designers, managers, or key stakeholders.
